# Helpful Review Predictor
- A supervised machine learning project that classifies the helpfulness of product reviews using a Random Forest model.
- Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning (using GridSearchCV), model comparison (logistic regression v.s. random forest), and performance evaluation (based on accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, roc, and auc).
---
- Trained on the bookReviewsData.csv data set which contains two columns:
    - ```Review```: the review text
    - ```Helpful Review```: binary label (1 = helpful, 0 = not helpful)
- Additional engineered features:
    - Number of exclamation marks
    - Number of question marks
    - Number of periods
    - Review length
- The dataset was cleaned and balanced before modeling.
